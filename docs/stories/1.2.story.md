## Dev Notes

### Testing

**Testing Standards from Architecture [Source: docs/architecture/15-测试策略.md]:**

- Follow test pyramid model: Unit tests > Integration tests > E2E tests [Source: docs/architecture/15-测试策略.md]
- Test file location: Tests should be co-located with source files using `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extension
- Testing frameworks:
  - Backend: Jest for unit and integration tests
  - Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library for component tests
  - E2E: Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Each service must have tests for controllers, services, and repositories
- Aim for minimum 80% code coverage on critical business logic

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1 completion:

- Monorepo structure is established with apps/api/user-service
- Prisma database configuration is working with basic User and Role models
- TypeScript configuration and ESLint rules are set up across all services
- Controller-Service-Repository pattern structure exists in user-service

### Technical Stack [Source: docs/architecture/3-技术栈.md]

- **Backend**: Node.js v20.x, Prisma v5+, PostgreSQL v16+ [Source: docs/architecture/3-技术栈.md]
- **Authentication**: JWT-based stateless authentication [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- **Password Security**: bcrypt for password hashing
- **Language**: TypeScript for all JavaScript/Node.js code

### Data Models [Source: docs/architecture/4-数据模型.md]

The existing Prisma schema includes core User and Role models that need enhancement:

- **User**: Already includes employeeId and domainAccount fields for future SSO [Source: docs/architecture/4-数据模型.md]
- **Role**: For role-based access control [Source: docs/architecture/4-数据模型.md]
- Required roles: 员工 (Employee), 技术员 (Technician), 主管 (Supervisor)

### Backend Architecture Pattern [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

Each microservice must follow this structure:

- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests/responses [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- Services: Contain business logic [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- Repositories: Handle data access via Prisma [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- Use repository pattern to encapsulate Prisma calls [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- Implement JWT-based stateless authentication [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

### API Specifications [Source: architecture.md#5]

- REST API style using OpenAPI 3.0 standards
- Authentication endpoints should follow REST conventions:
  - POST /api/auth/register - User registration
  - POST /api/auth/login - User authentication
- API responses should include proper HTTP status codes
- JWT tokens should be returned in response body with appropriate expiry

### File Locations [Source: docs/architecture/11-统一项目结构.md]

Based on the established monorepo structure:

```text
apps/api/user-service/
├── src/
│   ├── controllers/        # AuthController
│   ├── services/          # AuthService
│   ├── repositories/      # UserRepository
│   ├── middleware/        # JWT and role-based guards
│   ├── types/            # TypeScript interfaces
│   └── utils/            # Helper functions (password hashing)
└── __tests__/            # Test files co-located
```

### Security Requirements [Source: docs/architecture/14-安全与性能.md]

- HTTPS enforcement for all API communications
- Input validation for all authentication endpoints
- Password hashing using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
- JWT token validation with proper expiry handling
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks

### Technical Constraints

- Must integrate with existing Prisma database configuration from Story 1.1
- Must follow established TypeScript and ESLint configurations
- Authentication must be stateless to support microservices architecture
- Role-based access control must be extensible for future features

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall assessment**: The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria and provides a solid foundation for the authentication system. The developer has created a comprehensive, well-structured authentication system following proper architectural patterns. However, several improvements were made during the review to enhance performance, security, and maintainability.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/apps/api/user-service/src/repositories/UserRepository.ts`
  - **Change**: Optimized `findByIdentifier` method to use single query with OR condition instead of sequential queries
