- Assignee filtering using User relationships
- Asset filtering using Asset relationships
- Full-text search across title, description, and resolution fields
- Sorting by multiple columns with configurable direction
- Pagination with configurable page sizes

### Backend Architecture Pattern [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

Following established microservice structure:

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests/responses [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- **Services**: Contain business logic [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- **Repositories**: Handle data access via Prisma [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication with role-based authorization [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

Extensions needed:

- WorkOrderService requires advanced query builder methods
- New filtering and export endpoints in WorkOrderController
- Repository pattern extensions for complex Prisma queries

### Frontend Architecture Pattern [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]

Next.js Web application should follow:

- **组件**: 采用分层结构(ui, layout, features, forms)和标准化的编码模板 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **状态管理**: 使用 Zustand，并按业务领域划分 Store [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **路由**: 使用 Next.js App Router，并通过在布局中检查认证状态来保护路由 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **服务层**: 创建统一的 API 客户端，将 API 调用逻辑与 UI 组件分离 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]

### API Specifications [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-规范.md]

- REST API style using OpenAPI 3.0 standards [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-规范.md]
- Advanced filtering endpoints should follow REST conventions:
  - GET /api/work-orders - Enhanced with query parameters for filtering
  - GET /api/work-orders/export - CSV export endpoint
  - GET /api/work-orders/filter-options - Get available filter values
  - Query parameters: status, assigneeId, assetId, dateFrom, dateTo, search, page, limit, sortBy, sortOrder
- All endpoints require authentication (JWT token validation)
- Supervisor role required for accessing all work orders and export functionality

### Security Requirements [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

- JWT token validation with proper role-based authorization
- Supervisor role required for accessing work order management and export functionality
- Input validation for all filter parameters to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting for export operations to prevent abuse
- Audit trail for data export operations

### Core Workflow Integration

Advanced filtering extends the existing work order management workflow:

1. Supervisor logs in with appropriate permissions
2. Accesses work order management page with full work order list
3. Uses advanced filters to narrow down results by multiple criteria
4. Reviews filtered results with sorting and pagination
5. Exports filtered results to CSV for external analysis
6. Filter states are preserved in URL for sharing and bookmarking

### Technical Constraints

- Advanced queries must be optimized for performance with large datasets
- Filter combinations should not result in overly complex SQL queries
- CSV export must handle large result sets efficiently
- UI must remain responsive during filtering operations
- Filter state must be shareable via URL parameters
- Pagination must work correctly with all filter combinations
- Full-text search must be efficient and accurate

### Project Structure Notes

File paths and component locations align with established project structure. The advanced filtering functionality extends the existing work-order-service and requires new management pages in the web application for supervisors.
