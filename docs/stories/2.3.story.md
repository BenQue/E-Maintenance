### Data Models [Source: docs/architecture/4-数据模型.md]

Existing WorkOrder model from Story 2.1-2.2 includes assignment and status capabilities.

New models needed for resolution recording:

```typescript
model ResolutionRecord {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())
  workOrderId     String   @unique // One-to-one relationship with WorkOrder
  workOrder       WorkOrder @relation(fields: [workOrderId], references: [id])

  solutionDescription  String   // Required description of solution
  faultCode           FaultCode?  // Optional fault code classification

  // Photo attachments
  photos          ResolutionPhoto[]

  resolvedById    String   // Technician who resolved the issue
  resolvedBy      User     @relation(fields: [resolvedById], references: [id])

  completedAt     DateTime @default(now())
  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime @updatedAt
}

model ResolutionPhoto {
  id                String   @id @default(cuid())
  resolutionRecordId String
  resolutionRecord  ResolutionRecord @relation(fields: [resolutionRecordId], references: [id])

  filename        String
  originalName    String
  filePath        String   // Storage path
  fileSize        Int      // File size in bytes
  mimeType        String   // Image MIME type

  uploadedAt      DateTime @default(now())
}

enum FaultCode {
  MECHANICAL_FAILURE     // 机械故障
  ELECTRICAL_FAILURE     // 电气故障
  SOFTWARE_ISSUE         // 软件问题
  WEAR_AND_TEAR         // 磨损老化
  USER_ERROR            // 操作错误
  PREVENTIVE_MAINTENANCE // 预防性维护
  EXTERNAL_FACTOR       // 外部因素
  OTHER                 // 其他
}

// Extend Asset model for maintenance history
model MaintenanceHistory {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())
  assetId         String
  asset           Asset    @relation(fields: [assetId], references: [id])

  workOrderId     String   @unique
  workOrder       WorkOrder @relation(fields: [workOrderId], references: [id])

  // Denormalized data for quick access
  workOrderTitle  String
  resolutionSummary String?
  faultCode       FaultCode?
  technician      String   // Technician name

  completedAt     DateTime
  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
}
```

Required fields for ResolutionRecord: `workOrderId`, `solutionDescription`, `resolvedById`

### Backend Architecture Pattern [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

Following established microservice structure:

- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests/responses [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- Services: Contain business logic [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- Repositories: Handle data access via Prisma [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- Use repository pattern to encapsulate Prisma calls [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- Implement JWT-based stateless authentication [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

### Frontend Architecture Pattern [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]

Next.js Web application should follow:

- **组件**: 采用分层结构(ui, layout, features, forms)和标准化的编码模板 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **状态管理**: 使用 Zustand，并按业务领域划分 Store [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **路由**: 使用 Next.js App Router，并通过在布局中检查认证状态来保护路由 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **服务层**: 创建统一的 API 客户端，将 API 调用逻辑与 UI 组件分离 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]

### API Specifications [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-规范.md]

- REST API style using OpenAPI 3.0 standards [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-规范.md]
- Work order completion endpoints should follow REST conventions:
  - POST /api/work-orders/:id/complete - Complete work order with resolution
  - POST /api/work-orders/:id/photos - Upload completion photos
  - GET /api/assets/:id/maintenance-history - Get asset maintenance history
  - GET /api/work-orders/:id/resolution - Get work order resolution details
- API responses should include proper HTTP status codes
- All endpoints require authentication (JWT token validation)
- Work order completion operations require technician role and ownership validation
- Photo upload should support multipart/form-data with file size limits

### Security Requirements [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

- JWT token validation with proper role-based authorization
- Technicians can only complete their assigned work orders
- Photo upload validation for file type, size, and content
- Input validation for all completion endpoints
- Audit trail for all work order completions
- Secure file storage with proper access controls

### Core Workflow Integration [Source: docs/architecture/7-核心工作流.md]

Extends the existing work order management workflow:

1. Work order assigned to technician (from Story 2.1)
2. Technician updates status during work (from Story 2.2)
3. **NEW**: Technician completes work order with resolution details
4. **NEW**: Technician uploads completion photos
5. **NEW**: System automatically archives to asset maintenance history
6. **NEW**: Work order status changes to COMPLETED automatically
7. **NEW**: Maintenance history becomes available for asset reviews

### Technical Constraints

- Must integrate with existing work order status system from Story 2.2
- Must follow established authentication middleware and role-based guards
- Photo uploads must be validated for security (file type, size, content scanning)
- Resolution records must be immutable once created
- Mobile app must work offline for resolution recording (with data sync when online)
- Asset maintenance history must be efficiently queryable
- Photo storage must be scalable and secure
- Work order completion should automatically update status to COMPLETED

### Project Structure Notes

File paths and component locations align with established project structure. The completion functionality extends the existing work-order-service and requires enhanced screens in both web and mobile applications for technicians and new asset management screens for maintenance history.

## Testing

**Testing Standards from Architecture [Source: docs/architecture/15-测试策略.md]:**

- Follow test pyramid model: Unit tests > Integration tests > E2E tests [Source: docs/architecture/15-测试策略.md]

  - Testing frameworks: Jest for unit and integration tests
  - Each service must have tests for controllers, services, and repositories
  - Aim for minimum 80% code coverage on critical business logic
- **Frontend Testing**:
  - Component tests using React Testing Library and Jest
  - Unit tests for business logic and services
  - Integration tests for complete user flows
  - Test file location: `__tests__/` directories or co-located `.test.tsx` files
- **Mobile Testing**:
  - Widget tests for UI components using Flutter test framework
  - Unit tests for business logic and models
  - Integration tests for complete user flows
