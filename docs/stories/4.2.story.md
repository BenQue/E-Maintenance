4. API 客户端自动在请求头中附加 Bearer token。
5. 实现 token 过期检测和自动清理机制。
6. 提供登出功能，清理 token 和用户状态。

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 4.1 completion:

- `auth-service.ts` and `auth-store.ts` already created with comprehensive JWT token management
- Authentication persistence across page refresh implemented with JWT payload parsing
- Role-based redirect logic and user state management in place
- Comprehensive error handling with specific HTTP status codes
- Security measures including input validation and token expiration handling

**Critical Note**: Story 4.1 appears to have implemented most of Story 4.2's requirements. This story should focus on verification, integration gaps, and any missing authentication flow components not covered in 4.1.

- **Frontend**: Next.js v14+ for Web application [Source: docs/architecture/3-技术栈.md]
- **Backend**: Node.js v20.x, Prisma v5+, PostgreSQL v16+ [Source: docs/architecture/3-技术栈.md]
- **Language**: TypeScript for frontend and backend

### Data Models [Source: docs/architecture/4-数据模型.md]

**User Model**: Core user data with role-based access control [Source: docs/architecture/4-数据模型.md]

- Contains employeeId and domainAccount for future SSO integration
- Role-based authorization system (EMPLOYEE, TECHNICIAN, SUPERVISOR, ADMIN)

### Frontend Architecture Pattern [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]

- **组件**: 采用分层结构(ui, layout, features, forms)和标准化的编码模板 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **状态管理**: 使用 Zustand，并按业务领域划分 Store [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **路由**: 使用 Next.js App Router，并通过在布局中检查认证状态来保护路由 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **服务层**: 创建统一的 API 客户端，将 API 调用逻辑与 UI 组件分离 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]

### API Specifications [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-规范.md]

- REST API style using OpenAPI 3.0 standards [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-规范.md]
- API 网关作为统一入口，管理对后端微服务的访问 [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-规范.md]
- Authentication header format: Bearer {token}
- Expected JWT token structure with user information and roles

### Backend Authentication Architecture [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

- **认证授权**: 基于 JWT 实现无状态认证，API 网关负责 Token 校验，微服务内部通过守卫实现基于角色的授权 [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- JWT tokens are stateless and contain user role information
- Microservices use repository pattern with Prisma calls [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

### File Locations [Source: docs/architecture/11-统一项目结构.md]

Based on Monorepo structure [Source: docs/architecture/11-统一项目结构.md]:

**Files Already Created (from Story 4.1):**

```text
apps/web/lib/services/auth-service.ts       # Authentication service
apps/web/lib/stores/auth-store.ts          # Zustand authentication store
```

**Files Potentially Needed:**

```text
apps/web/lib/services/
├── api-client.ts                           # Unified API client base class
├── base-service.ts                         # Base service with auth integration
└── interceptors/
    ├── auth-interceptor.ts                 # Request/response interceptors for auth
    └── error-interceptor.ts                # Error handling interceptor
```

### Component Pattern Requirements [Source: docs/architecture/16-编码标准.md]

- **Monorepo Structure**: 所有代码必须遵循已定义的 apps/和 packages/结构 [Source: docs/architecture/16-编码标准.md]
- **State Management**: 状态应通过领域特定的 Zustand stores 进行管理 [Source: docs/architecture/16-编码标准.md]
- **Service Layer**: 所有 API 通信必须通过定义的服务层进行 [Source: docs/architecture/16-编码标准.md]

### Technical Constraints

- Must integrate with existing JWT authentication from user-service (port 3001)
- API client must work with all microservices (user-service: 3001, work-order-service: 3002, asset-service: 3003)
- Token management must be consistent across all API calls
- Error handling must provide proper user feedback without exposing system details
- Must support automatic token refresh if backend provides refresh tokens
- Integration must not break existing authentication functionality from Story 4.1

### Project Structure Notes

This story builds upon the authentication foundation created in Story 4.1. The main focus should be on creating a unified API client system that automatically handles authentication for all backend service communication, rather than recreating existing authentication components.

## Testing

**Testing Standards from Architecture [Source: docs/architecture/15-测试策略.md]:**

- Follow test pyramid model: Unit tests > Integration tests > E2E tests [Source: docs/architecture/15-测试策略.md]
- **Frontend Testing**:
  - Unit tests for authentication integration logic using Jest
  - Integration tests for complete authentication flow with API clients
  - Test file location: `__tests__/` directories or co-located `.test.ts` files

### Testing Specific Requirements for Story 4.2

- Test unified API client with mock authentication tokens
- Test automatic Bearer token attachment to requests
- Test request/response interceptors for authentication errors
- Test token expiration handling and automatic cleanup
- Test API client error handling for 401/403 responses
- Test authentication state synchronization across API calls
- Mock all backend service endpoints for isolated testing
- Test logout functionality clears all authentication state
- Test concurrent API requests with authentication
- Integration tests for authentication flow with multiple services

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: Excellent Implementation with Strategic Architectural Improvements**

This is a high-quality implementation that demonstrates solid understanding of enterprise authentication patterns. The developer successfully integrated authentication concerns into a unified API client system while maintaining clean separation of concerns. The code exhibits professional-grade error handling, retry logic, and comprehensive test coverage. I've made several strategic improvements to enhance maintainability, performance, and security.

**Strengths:**
- Clean integration between auth-service, auth-store, and api-client
- Comprehensive error handling with automatic logout on 401 errors
- Proper timeout and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Excellent test coverage with 20 passing tests covering all scenarios
- Good TypeScript usage with proper type definitions
- Secure token management integration with existing authentication system

**Areas Enhanced During Review:**
- Improved error handling for dynamic import failures
- Enhanced type safety with stricter error class definitions
- Optimized retry logic to prevent unnecessary network calls
- Added better JSDoc documentation for complex authentication flows
- Strengthened circular dependency prevention patterns

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `apps/web/lib/services/api-client.ts`
- **Change**: Enhanced error handling in the dynamic auth-store import (lines 78-83)
- **Why**: The original try-catch was too broad and could mask other import issues
- **How**: Added specific error handling for import failures with proper logging, prevents silent failures that could lead to authentication state inconsistencies

**File**: `apps/web/lib/services/api-client.ts`
- **Change**: Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation for the ApiClient class and key methods
- **Why**: Complex authentication logic needs clear documentation for future maintainers
- **How**: Added detailed method signatures, parameter descriptions, and usage examples

**File**: `apps/web/lib/services/__tests__/api-client.test.ts`
- **Change**: Enhanced test descriptions and added edge case coverage for import failures
- **Why**: Tests serve as living documentation and should clearly describe expected behavior
- **How**: Made test descriptions more descriptive and added test cases for dynamic import error scenarios

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent adherence to TypeScript patterns, proper error handling, clean code principles
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect alignment with monorepo structure, files in correct locations with proper naming
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage following test pyramid with unit tests, mocking strategies, and meaningful assertions
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented and properly tested

### Improvements Checklist
