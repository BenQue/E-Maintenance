## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.4 completion:

- Controller-Service-Repository pattern is established in work-order-service
- JWT authentication and role-based authorization middleware are implemented
- Prisma database configuration with User, Asset, and WorkOrder models is working
- TypeScript interfaces and validation schemas are established
- Web frontend architecture with Next.js and Zustand state management patterns are ready

### Technical Stack [Source: docs/architecture/3-技术栈.md]

- **Frontend**: Next.js v14+ for Web application [Source: docs/architecture/3-技术栈.md]
- **Backend**: Node.js v20.x, Prisma v5+, PostgreSQL v16+ [Source: docs/architecture/3-技术栈.md]
- **Authentication**: JWT-based stateless authentication [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- **Language**: TypeScript for both frontend and backend

### Data Models [Source: docs/architecture/4-数据模型.md]

Existing WorkOrder model supports assignment tracking:

```typescript
model WorkOrder {
  // ... existing fields
  assignedToId    String?  // Foreign key for assigned technician
  assignedTo      User?    @relation("AssignedTo", fields: [assignedToId], references: [id])
}
```

New models needed for assignment rules:

```typescript
model AssignmentRule {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())
  name            String   // Rule description
  priority        Int      @default(0) // Rule priority for conflict resolution
  isActive        Boolean  @default(true)

  // Matching conditions
  assetTypes      String[] // Asset type filter
  categories      String[] // Work order category filter
  locations       String[] // Location filter
  priorities      String[] // Priority filter

  // Assignment target
  assignToId      String   // Target technician
  assignTo        User     @relation(fields: [assignToId], references: [id])

  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime @updatedAt
}

model Notification {
  id              String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId          String   // Target user
  user            User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])

  type            NotificationType
  title           String
  message         String
  isRead          Boolean  @default(false)

  // Optional reference to related entity
  workOrderId     String?
  workOrder       WorkOrder? @relation(fields: [workOrderId], references: [id])

  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
}

enum NotificationType {
  WORK_ORDER_ASSIGNED
  WORK_ORDER_UPDATED
  SYSTEM_ALERT
}
```

Required fields for AssignmentRule: `name`, `assignToId`
Required fields for Notification: `userId`, `type`, `title`, `message`

### Backend Architecture Pattern [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

Following established microservice structure:

- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests/responses [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- Services: Contain business logic [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- Repositories: Handle data access via Prisma [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- Use repository pattern to encapsulate Prisma calls [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- Implement JWT-based stateless authentication [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

### Frontend Architecture Pattern [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]

Next.js Web application should follow:

- **组件**: 采用分层结构(ui, layout, features, forms)和标准化的编码模板 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **状态管理**: 使用 Zustand，并按业务领域划分 Store [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **路由**: 使用 Next.js App Router，并通过在布局中检查认证状态来保护路由 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **服务层**: 创建统一的 API 客户端，将 API 调用逻辑与 UI 组件分离 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]

### API Specifications [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-规范.md]

- REST API style using OpenAPI 3.0 standards [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-规范.md]
- Assignment and notification endpoints should follow REST conventions:
  - GET /api/assignment-rules - List assignment rules
  - POST /api/assignment-rules - Create assignment rule
  - PUT /api/assignment-rules/:id - Update assignment rule
  - DELETE /api/assignment-rules/:id - Delete assignment rule
  - POST /api/work-orders/:id/assign - Manually assign work order
  - GET /api/notifications - Get user notifications
  - PUT /api/notifications/:id/read - Mark notification as read
- API responses should include proper HTTP status codes
- All endpoints require authentication (JWT token validation)
- Assignment operations require supervisor role authorization

### File Locations [Source: docs/architecture/11-统一项目结构.md]

Based on the established monorepo structure:

```

### Security Requirements [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

- JWT token validation with proper role-based authorization
- Only supervisors can create/modify assignment rules
- Only supervisors can manually assign/reassign work orders
- Technicians can only view their assigned work orders
- Notification access restricted to target user only
- Input validation for all rule configuration endpoints

### Core Workflow Integration [Source: docs/architecture/7-核心工作流.md]

Extends the existing "创建新维修工单" workflow:

1. Work order created (existing flow)
2. **NEW**: Auto-assignment rules evaluation
3. **NEW**: Assign to matching technician if rule found
4. **NEW**: Send notification to assigned technician
5. **NEW**: Allow manual reassignment by supervisor

### Technical Constraints

- Must integrate with existing Prisma database configuration and extend with new models
- Must follow established TypeScript and ESLint configurations
- Must reuse existing authentication middleware and role-based guards
- Assignment rules must be evaluated in priority order
- Notification system should be extensible for future notification types
- Web interface must be responsive and accessible
- Real-time notifications should be considered for future enhancement

### Project Structure Notes

File paths and component locations align with established project structure. The assignment and notification features extend the existing work-order-service and require new frontend pages in the dashboard area for supervisors.

## Testing

**Testing Standards from Architecture [Source: docs/architecture/15-测试策略.md]:**

- Follow test pyramid model: Unit tests > Integration tests > E2E tests [Source: docs/architecture/15-测试策略.md]
- **Backend Testing**:
  - Test file location: Tests should be co-located with source files using `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extension
  - Testing frameworks: Jest for unit and integration tests
  - Each service must have tests for controllers, services, and repositories
  - Aim for minimum 80% code coverage on critical business logic
- **Frontend Testing**:
  - Component tests using React Testing Library and Jest
  - Unit tests for business logic and services
  - Integration tests for complete user flows
  - Test file location: `__tests__/` directories or co-located `.test.tsx` files

### Testing Specific Requirements for Story 2.1

- Test assignment rule matching algorithms with various scenarios
- Test automatic assignment trigger when work orders are created
- Test manual assignment and reassignment functionality
- Test notification creation and delivery
- Test rule priority handling and conflict resolution
- Test authorization for rule management and assignment operations
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Test error handling for invalid rule configurations
