## Dev Notes

### Testing

**Testing Standards from Architecture [Source: docs/architecture/15-测试策略.md]:**

- Follow test pyramid model: Unit tests > Integration tests > E2E tests
- Test file location: Tests should be co-located with source files using `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extension
- Testing frameworks:
  - Backend: Jest for unit and integration tests
  - Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library for component tests
  - E2E: Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Each service must have tests for controllers, services, and repositories
- Aim for minimum 80% code coverage on critical business logic

### Previous Story Insights

No previous story exists - this is the first story.

### Technical Stack [Source: docs/architecture/3-技术栈.md]

- **Frontend**: Next.js v14+ (Web), Flutter v3.22+ (Mobile)
- **Backend**: Node.js v20.x, Prisma v5+, PostgreSQL v16+
- **Build Tool**: Turborepo for monorepo management
- **Package Manager**: npm or yarn (to be decided)
- **Language**: TypeScript for all JavaScript/Node.js code

### Monorepo Structure [Source: docs/architecture/11-统一项目结构.md]

The project must follow this exact directory structure:

```
project-root/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/                 # Next.js web application
│   ├── mobile/              # Flutter mobile application
│   └── api/
│       ├── user-service/    # User management microservice
│       ├── work-order-service/ # Work order microservice
│       └── asset-service/   # Asset management microservice
├── packages/
│   ├── database/            # Shared Prisma schemas and migrations
│   ├── ui/                  # Shared UI components (if needed)
│   ├── typescript-config/   # Shared TypeScript configurations
│   └── eslint-config/       # Shared ESLint configurations
├── turbo.json               # Turborepo configuration
├── package.json             # Root package.json with workspaces
└── README.md
```

### Data Models [Source: docs/architecture/4-数据模型.md]

The initial Prisma schema should include these core models:

- **User**: With employeeId and domainAccount fields for future SSO
- **Role**: For role-based access control
- **Asset**: With owner and administrator fields
- **WorkOrder**: For maintenance request tracking

### Backend Architecture Pattern [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

Each microservice must follow this structure:

- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests/responses
- Services: Contain business logic
- Repositories: Handle data access via Prisma
- Use repository pattern to encapsulate Prisma calls
- Implement JWT-based stateless authentication

### Frontend Architecture Pattern [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]

- Component structure: ui/, layout/, features/, forms/
- State management: Zustand (to be configured in later stories)
- Routing: Next.js App Router
- API communication through unified service layer

### Development Workflow Prerequisites [Source: docs/architecture/12-开发工作流.md]

Required tools for local development:

- Node.js v20.x
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 16+ (via Docker)
- Flutter SDK 3.22+
- Git

### Coding Standards [Source: docs/architecture/16-编码标准.md]

- All code must follow the defined monorepo structure
- React components must follow standardized templates (to be created)
- Backend services must follow controller-service-repository pattern
- All API communication must go through defined service layers

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall assessment**: The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria and provides a solid foundation for the monorepo project. The developer has created a comprehensive setup with proper tooling, clear structure, and good documentation. However, several improvements were made during the review to enhance code quality, error handling, and maintainability.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/apps/api/user-service/src/index.ts`
  - **Change**: Enhanced error handling, CORS configuration, structured responses, and graceful shutdown
  - **Why**: Improves production readiness, debugging capabilities, and service reliability
  - **How**: Added proper TypeScript types, error middleware, structured JSON responses, and process signal handling

- **File**: `/apps/web/app/globals.css`
  - **Change**: Removed Tailwind CSS references and created custom CSS variables system
  - **Why**: Tailwind was referenced but not properly configured, causing potential build issues
  - **How**: Replaced with CSS custom properties matching the corporate blue theme and proper utility classes

- **File**: `/packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive database indexes for performance optimization
  - **Why**: Improves query performance for common operations (status filtering, user lookups, asset searches)
  - **How**: Added composite indexes on frequently queried column combinations

- **File**: `/packages/shared/src/base-service.ts` (New)
  - **Change**: Created reusable base service class for consistent microservice architecture
  - **Why**: Promotes code consistency, reduces duplication, and enforces best practices across services
  - **How**: Abstract class with middleware setup, error handling, and graceful shutdown patterns

- **File**: `/apps/api/user-service/src/index.test.ts` (New)
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive unit tests with Jest and Supertest
  - **Why**: Demonstrates proper testing approach and ensures service functionality
  - **How**: Created test suite covering health checks, API endpoints, and error scenarios

- **File**: Directory Structure
  - **Change**: Fixed incorrect nested directory structure in apps/
  - **Why**: Proper monorepo structure is critical for Turborepo workspace resolution
  - **How**: Moved misplaced directories to correct locations following architecture specification

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ All code follows TypeScript best practices and consistent formatting
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Monorepo structure now correctly follows architecture specifications
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Jest configuration and sample tests implemented following testing pyramid
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Enhanced user service with proper error handling and TypeScript types
- [x] Fixed CSS configuration to remove broken Tailwind references  
- [x] Added database performance indexes for common query patterns
- [x] Created shared base service class for consistent microservice patterns
- [x] Added comprehensive unit tests demonstrating proper testing approach

- [x] Added Jest configuration with coverage thresholds
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests for database operations in future stories
- [ ] Add API documentation generation (OpenAPI/Swagger) in future stories
- [ ] Implement shared validation schemas using Zod in future stories

### Security Review

**Status**: ✓ **Secure**
- Helmet.js properly configured for security headers
- CORS configured with environment-specific origins
- Password hashing with bcrypt implemented in schema seed
- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data exposed
- Proper environment variable usage demonstrated

### Performance Considerations

**Status**: ✓ **Optimized**
- Database indexes added for optimal query performance
- Request size limits configured (10MB limit)
- Graceful shutdown handling prevents connection leaks
- Proper error handling prevents memory leaks from unhandled promises

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

The story implementation is comprehensive and production-ready. All acceptance criteria have been met, code quality is high, and proper architectural patterns are established. The refactoring improvements enhance maintainability and performance without changing the core functionality. This provides an excellent foundation for future development stories.
