## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 3.3 completion:

- Permission validation and JWT authentication patterns are in place
- API service layer patterns for complex data queries are established
- Zustand state management for supervisor operations is implemented
- Advanced filtering and management components are available for reuse

### Technical Stack [Source: docs/architecture/3-技术栈.md]

- **Frontend**: Next.js v14+ for Web application [Source: docs/architecture/3-技术栈.md]
- **Backend**: Node.js v20.x, Prisma v5+, PostgreSQL v16+ [Source: docs/architecture/3-技术栈.md]
- **Authentication**: JWT-based stateless authentication [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- **Language**: TypeScript for frontend and backend

### Data Models [Source: docs/architecture/4-数据模型.md]

**User Model**: Core user data with role-based access control [Source: docs/architecture/4-数据模型.md]

- **email**: String (unique) - User email address for login
- **username**: String (unique) - User login name
- **password**: String - Encrypted password for authentication
- **role**: UserRole (EMPLOYEE, TECHNICIAN, SUPERVISOR, ADMIN) - User's system role
- **isActive**: Boolean (default: true) - User activation status
- **firstName**: String - User's first name for display
- **lastName**: String - User's last name for display

### Frontend Architecture Pattern [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]

Next.js Web application follows:

- **组件**: 采用分层结构(ui, layout, features, forms)和标准化的编码模板 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **状态管理**: 使用 Zustand，并按业务领域划分 Store [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **路由**: 使用 Next.js App Router，并通过在布局中检查认证状态来保护路由 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]
- **服务层**: 创建统一的 API 客户端，将 API 调用逻辑与 UI 组件分离 [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]

### API Specifications [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-规范.md]

- REST API style using OpenAPI 3.0 standards [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-规范.md]
- Login endpoint pattern expected: POST /api/auth/login
- Expected request format: { email/username: string, password: string }
- Expected response format: { token: string, user: UserObject }
- Authentication header format: Bearer {token}

### Backend Authentication Architecture [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

- **认证授权**: 基于 JWT 实现无状态认证，API 网关负责 Token 校验，微服务内部通过守卫实现基于角色的授权 [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]
- JWT tokens are stateless and contain user role information
- Tokens should be validated on subsequent API requests
- Role-based authorization is enforced at the microservice level

### Component Pattern Requirements [Source: docs/architecture/16-编码标准.md]

- **Component Pattern**: React 组件必须遵循已提供的模板 [Source: docs/architecture/16-编码标准.md]
- **State Management**: 状态应通过领域特定的 Zustand stores 进行管理 [Source: docs/architecture/16-编码标准.md]
- **Service Layer**: 所有 API 通信必须通过定义的服务层进行 [Source: docs/architecture/16-编码标准.md]

### Security Requirements [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

- JWT token secure storage (localStorage with future upgrade to httpOnly cookies)
- Input validation for email/username and password fields
- Protection against injection attacks through proper form sanitization
- Secure transmission of credentials over HTTPS
- Proper error handling without exposing system details
- Token expiration handling and automatic cleanup

### Technical Constraints

- Login must work with existing JWT authentication system from user-service
- Page must be accessible without authentication (public route)
- Must integrate with existing Next.js App Router navigation
- Form validation must provide clear user feedback
- Loading states must prevent multiple simultaneous login attempts
- Must handle both email and username login methods
- Successful login must preserve intended destination (redirect after login)

### Project Structure Notes

File paths and component locations align with established project structure. The login page extends the existing Next.js web application and requires integration with the existing user-service authentication system.

## Testing

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: Excellent Implementation with Critical Improvements Applied**

The implementation demonstrates solid architectural understanding and follows established patterns consistently. The developer successfully delivered all acceptance criteria with comprehensive functionality. During my review, I identified and resolved several critical issues that significantly improve the robustness, security, and user experience of the login system.

**Strengths:**

- Clean separation of concerns with proper service layer and state management architecture
- Comprehensive form validation with real-time error clearing
- Proper JWT token management and storage patterns
- Role-based redirect logic correctly implemented
- Excellent test coverage for authentication service logic
- Consistent use of TypeScript for type safety
- Good accessibility considerations in form design

**Areas Improved During Review:**

- Fixed critical authentication persistence issue that would have broken role-based navigation on page refresh
- Enhanced error handling with specific status code messages for better user experience
- Improved UI component design with better error state handling
- Added comprehensive form validation including email format and password length validation
- Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA attributes and screen reader support
- Strengthened test coverage with additional error scenario testing

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `apps/web/lib/stores/auth-store.ts`

- **Change**: Fixed critical `checkAuth` method to properly extract and restore user data from JWT token payload
- **Why**: The original implementation only set `isAuthenticated: true` without recovering user data, causing role-based navigation to fail after page refresh
- **How**: Added JWT payload parsing to extract complete user information, enabling proper authentication persistence across browser sessions

**File**: `apps/web/components/forms/LoginForm.tsx`

- **Change**: Added authentication check on component mount and enhanced form validation
- **Why**: Components need to check for existing authentication when loaded, and forms should validate email format and password strength
- **How**: Added `useEffect` hook calling `checkAuth()` on mount, and enhanced validation logic with email regex and password length checks

**File**: `apps/web/components/ui/input.tsx`

- **Change**: Enhanced Input component with dedicated error prop and improved focus state styling
- **Why**: Better separation of concerns for error handling and improved visual feedback for users
- **How**: Added `error` boolean prop with conditional styling for error states and focus ring colors

**File**: `apps/web/lib/services/auth-service.ts`

- **Change**: Improved error handling with specific HTTP status code messages
- **Why**: Generic error messages provide poor user experience; specific messages help users understand what went wrong
- **How**: Added switch statement for different HTTP status codes (401, 403, 429, 500) with contextual Chinese error messages

**File**: `apps/web/components/forms/LoginForm.tsx` (Accessibility)

- **Change**: Added comprehensive ARIA attributes and screen reader support
- **Why**: Accessibility is crucial for inclusive web applications
- **How**: Added `role`, `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-invalid`, and `aria-live` attributes for proper screen reader navigation

**File**: `apps/web/lib/services/__tests__/auth-service.test.ts`

- **Change**: Enhanced test coverage with additional HTTP error code scenarios
- **Why**: Testing different error scenarios ensures robust error handling in production
- **How**: Added tests for 403 Forbidden and 429 Too Many Requests scenarios with appropriate Chinese error messages
