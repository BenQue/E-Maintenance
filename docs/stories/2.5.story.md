## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.1-2.4 completion and current system analysis:

- Controller-Service-Repository pattern is well established in work-order-service
- JWT authentication and role-based authorization middleware are working
- Existing upload middleware and ResolutionPhoto model provide foundation
- Mobile PhotoCaptureScreen component is already implemented and functional
- Web frontend architecture with Next.js and component patterns are established

### Technical Stack [Source: docs/architecture/3-技术栈.md]

- **Frontend**: Next.js v14+ for Web application, Flutter 3.22+ for Mobile
- **Backend**: Node.js v20.x, Prisma v5+, PostgreSQL v16+
- **File Processing**: Sharp library for image processing and thumbnail generation
- **Authentication**: JWT-based stateless authentication with role-based authorization
- **Language**: TypeScript for backend, Dart for Flutter mobile

### Data Models [Source: packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma]

Existing ResolutionPhoto model supports the photo storage requirements:

```typescript
model ResolutionPhoto {
  id                String   @id @default(cuid())
  resolutionRecordId String
  resolutionRecord  ResolutionRecord @relation(fields: [resolutionRecordId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  filename        String   // Generated unique filename
  originalName    String   // User's original filename
  filePath        String   // Relative storage path
  fileSize        Int      // File size in bytes
  mimeType        String   // Image MIME type

  uploadedAt      DateTime @default(now())

  @@index([resolutionRecordId])
  @@map("resolution_photos")
}
```

Additional support for work order attachments through existing attachments field:

```typescript
model WorkOrder {
  // ... existing fields
  attachments     String[]  // JSON array of attachment file paths
}
```

### File Storage Architecture [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-规范.md]

Storage path structure:

```
/uploads/work-orders/
├── 2025/
│   ├── 01/                    # Year/Month classification
│   │   ├── WO123-1642345678-device_fault.jpg
│   │   ├── WO123-1642345690-repair_complete.jpg
│   │   └── thumbnails/        # Auto-generated thumbnails
│   │       ├── thumb_WO123-1642345678-device_fault.jpg
│   │       └── thumb_WO123-1642345690-repair_complete.jpg
│   └── 02/
└── 2024/
```

File naming convention: `{workOrderId}-{timestamp}-{randomId}.{ext}`

### Backend Architecture Implementation [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

PhotoStorageService implementation approach:

```typescript
export class PhotoStorageService {
  private uploadDir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'uploads', 'work-orders');

  async savePhoto(file: Express.Multer.File, workOrderId: string): Promise<PhotoRecord> {
    // 1. Create year/month directory structure
    // 2. Generate unique filename with workOrderId prefix
    // 3. Save original image file
    // 4. Generate and save thumbnail using Sharp
    // 5. Return storage metadata
  }

  async getPhotoPath(relativePath: string): string {
    /* ... */
  }
  async getThumbnailPath(relativePath: string): string {
    /* ... */
  }
}
```

Integration with existing WorkOrderController:

- Extend with photo upload endpoints
- Implement proper permission checking via checkWorkOrderAccess middleware
- Support both fault photos (during creation) and resolution photos (during completion)

### Mobile Integration [Source: apps/mobile/lib/features/photo/photo_capture_screen.dart]

Existing PhotoCaptureScreen provides:

- Camera initialization and permission handling
- Photo capture and gallery selection
- Photo preview and confirmation interface

Required integration points:

1. **Work Order Creation**: Add photo attachment section to work order form
2. **Work Order Completion**: Add resolution photo upload to completion screen
3. **Service Layer**: Implement HTTP multipart upload in WorkOrderService
4. **Offline Support**: Cache photos locally when offline, sync when online

### Web Frontend Implementation [Source: docs/architecture/9-前端架构.md]

Component architecture for photo display:

```typescript
// WorkOrderPhotos component structure
interface WorkOrderPhotosProps {
  workOrderId: string;
}

// Features:
// - Grid layout for thumbnail display
// - Modal for full-size photo viewing
// - Lazy loading for performance
// - Responsive design for different screen sizes
// - Integration with existing work order detail pages
```

Following established patterns:

- Zustand for state management (if needed)
- API service layer separation
- Component composition approach
- TypeScript strict typing

### API Specifications [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-规范.md]

New photo-related endpoints:

```
POST   /api/work-orders/{workOrderId}/photos          # Upload photos
GET    /api/work-orders/{workOrderId}/photos          # List photos
GET    /api/work-orders/{workOrderId}/photos/{photoId} # Get photo file
GET    /api/work-orders/{workOrderId}/photos/{photoId}/thumbnail # Get thumbnail
```

All endpoints require authentication and work order access permission.
File uploads limited to 10MB per file, 5 files per request.
Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP.

### Security Requirements [Source: docs/architecture/10-后端架构.md]

- JWT token validation for all photo endpoints
- Work order access permission checking via existing checkWorkOrderAccess middleware
- File type validation to prevent malicious uploads
- File size limits to prevent storage abuse
- Path traversal protection in file serving
- Proper Content-Type headers for security

### Performance Considerations

- Thumbnail generation for fast loading on PC端
- Lazy loading for photo grids
- Proper HTTP caching headers for images
- File size optimization without quality loss
- Efficient database queries for photo metadata

### Integration Points

This story builds upon existing functionality:

- Extends existing upload middleware in work-order-service
- Leverages existing ResolutionPhoto database model
- Integrates with existing PhotoCaptureScreen in mobile app
- Uses established authentication and authorization patterns
- Follows existing component architecture in web frontend
